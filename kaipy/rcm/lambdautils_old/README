Supporting scripts:
 AlamData: class to store alam data, with functions to read from file
 plotter: basic plots of eta vs. alam, etc.

Main scripts:

 dpetadp: Includes functions for dp->eta and eta->dp
  - based on etautils.F90, toRCM.F90, and toMHD.F90
  - as main, see the eta distribution for a single value of density, pressure, and vm

 dpRangeEval: evaluate how well a certain alam distribution does for a range of densities and pressures
  - as main, just enter which rcmconfig file you want to use the alam channels from
  - density and pressure ranges set in main

genAlam: generate alam distribution and write it into an rcmconfig.h5

alamTester: Given an alam distribution, runs tests to see how good the distribution is
 - smearTest: See if lambda+ and lambda- drift farther than 1 grid cell spacing per timestep (bad)
